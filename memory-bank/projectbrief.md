# Address Validator++ - Project Brief

## Project Overview
**Name:** Address Validator++ (Shopify App)
**Vision:** A Shopify app that validates, corrects, and enforces customer shipping addresses during checkout using Google Maps + USPS/UPS DPV APIs to minimize failed deliveries, reduce merchant costs, and improve buyer confidence.

## Core Problem Statement
Merchants lose significant revenue and customer satisfaction due to failed deliveries caused by invalid or incorrect shipping addresses. Current solutions are either too expensive, too complex, or don't integrate seamlessly into the Shopify checkout experience.

## Primary Goals
1. **Solve Merchant Pain:** Reduce failed deliveries, refunds, and support tickets caused by bad addresses
2. **Customer Confidence:** Provide clear visual confirmation via Google Maps (rooftop pin)
3. **Hard Gating:** Block invalid addresses at checkout (with fallback options like nearest pickup)
4. **Quick Adoption:** Build an MVP with minimal friction and high utility so merchants see ROI in days, not weeks
5. **Scalable Add-ons:** Future extensions (e.g., international support, analytics, AI fraud detection)

## Target Market
- **Primary:** US-based Shopify merchants (SMBs to mid-size DTC brands)
- **Segments:** Food delivery, florists, apparel, subscription boxes — anyone with recurring delivery errors
- **Volume:** 100–50,000 monthly orders per merchant
- **Geographic Focus:** United States (initial MVP scope)

## Value Proposition
- Cut failed deliveries by 10–25%
- Reduce support load (address correction disputes, refund requests)
- Boost delivery success rates → happier customers → higher retention
- Real-time validation with visual confirmation
- Seamless checkout integration without friction

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in failed delivery rates per merchant
- Decreased support ticket volume related to shipping issues
- Merchant retention and satisfaction scores
- Time-to-value (merchants see results within days)
- API cost efficiency (Google Maps usage optimization)

## Key Constraints
1. **Integration Method:** Must use Shopify Checkout UI Extension (Checkout Extensibility, not Script Editor)
2. **Development Timeline:** MVP within 2–3 weeks
3. **Cost Control:** Implement caching layer for Google Maps API, only call on uncertainty
4. **Validation Authority:** Use USPS/UPS DPV API for authoritative validation
5. **User Experience:** No checkout friction - validation must be seamless

## Non-Goals (Future Scope)
- International address validation (post-MVP)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (post-MVP)
- AI-powered fraud detection (post-MVP)
- Multi-carrier shipping optimization (post-MVP)
