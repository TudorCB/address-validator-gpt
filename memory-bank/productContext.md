# Address Validator++ - Product Context

## Why This Product Exists

### The Problem
Shopify merchants lose millions of dollars annually due to failed deliveries caused by invalid, incomplete, or incorrect shipping addresses. The current ecosystem lacks a solution that:
- Integrates seamlessly into the Shopify checkout flow
- Provides real-time validation with visual confirmation
- Uses authoritative validation sources (USPS/UPS DPV)
- Offers immediate feedback without checkout friction
- Delivers ROI within days, not months

### Market Pain Points
1. **High Failure Rates:** 5-15% of deliveries fail due to address issues
2. **Support Overhead:** Address correction disputes consume 20-30% of merchant support time
3. **Refund Burden:** Failed deliveries result in chargebacks and manual refunds
4. **Customer Churn:** Delivery failures damage merchant reputation and customer trust
5. **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual address verification processes are slow and error-prone

### Current Solutions & Their Limitations
1. **Manual Verification:** Time-consuming, inconsistent, prone to human error
2. **Basic Form Validation:** Catches syntax errors but not real-world validity
3. **Third-party Address Services:** Often expensive, complex, or don't integrate with Shopify checkout
4. **Carrier Validation Post-Purchase:** Too late - order already placed and shipping costs incurred

## How Address Validator++ Solves These Problems
