# Address Validator++ - Active Context

## Current Development Focus

### Immediate Priority: MVP Implementation
The project is currently in the early implementation phase with the basic Shopify Remix template structure in place. The primary focus is on building the core MVP functionality to validate addresses during Shopify checkout.

### Current Status Snapshot
- ✅ Project foundation established (Shopify Remix template)
- ✅ Memory bank documentation created
- ⚠️ Core validation logic not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Checkout UI extension pending
- ⚠️ External API integrations needed
- ⚠️ Admin dashboard components missing

## Active Development Areas

### 1. Address Validation Pipeline (`app/lib/validateAddressPipeline.ts`)
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** High
**Tasks:**
- Implement syntax validation logic
- Create Google Maps validation integration
- Integrate USPS/UPS DPV validation
- Build caching layer logic
- Design result aggregation system

### 2. Checkout UI Extension (`extensions/checkout-ui/`)
**Status:** Implemented
**Priority:** High
**Tasks:**
- ✅ Implement extension entry point (`src/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Create UI components for address validation display
- ✅ Integrate with validation API endpoint
- ✅ Handle real-time validation feedback
- ✅ Implement visual confirmation with Google Maps

### 3. Validation API Endpoint (`app/routes/api/validate-address.ts`)
**Status:** Created but empty
**Priority:** High
**Tasks:**
- Implement POST handler for address validation requests
- Integrate with validation pipeline
- Add proper error handling and response formatting
- Implement rate limiting and security measures
- Add logging and monitoring hooks

### 4. External API Integration Libraries
**Status:** Partial files exist but incomplete
**Priority:** High
**Tasks:**
- Complete Google Maps integration (`app/lib/google.ts`)
- Create USPS Web Tools API client
- Create UPS Address Validation API client
- Implement caching layer (`app/lib/cache.ts`)
- Add proper error handling and fallback logic

## Current Implementation Challenges

### Technical Debt to Address
1. **Empty Implementation Files:** Several key files are created but contain only TODO comments
2. **Missing External Dependencies:** Need to install and configure Google Maps, USPS, and UPS API libraries
3. **Checkout Extension Complexity:** Shopify Checkout UI Extensions have specific requirements and limitations
4. **Performance Optimization:** Need to implement efficient caching to control API costs

### Integration Points Requiring Attention
1. **Shopify Authentication Flow:** Ensure proper OAuth implementation for merchant stores
2. **Webhook Processing:** Verify webhook signature validation and proper error handling
3. **Database Schema Extensions:** May need to extend Prisma schema for address validation logging
4. **Environment Configuration:** Proper setup of API keys and configuration variables

## Recent Decisions & Considerations

### Architectural Decisions Made
1. **Pipeline Approach:** Chose multi-stage validation pipeline for accuracy and flexibility
2. **Caching Strategy:** Will implement Redis-based caching to optimize API costs
3. **Extension Integration:** Using Shopify Checkout UI Extensions for seamless checkout integration
4. **Dual Validation:** Combining Google Maps + USPS/UPS for comprehensive validation

### Technology Choices
1. **TypeScript:** Maintaining strong typing for reliability and maintainability
2. **Prisma:** Continuing with existing ORM for database operations
3. **React:** Using existing component library for UI consistency
4. **Shopify CLI:** Leveraging existing development tooling

## Next Immediate Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (This Week)
1. **Implement Validation Pipeline** - Build the core validation logic foundation
2. **Setup External API Clients** - Create integration libraries for Google Maps, USPS, UPS
3. **Complete Checkout UI Extension** - Implement the checkout integration point
4. **Build Validation API Endpoint** - Create the main validation service endpoint

### Phase 2: Integration & Testing (Next Week)
1. **End-to-End Testing** - Test full validation flow from checkout to API to external services
2. **Performance Optimization** - Implement caching and optimize response times
3. **Error Handling** - Add comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Security Hardening** - Implement proper authentication and rate limiting

### Phase 3: Merchant Features (Week 3)
1. **Admin Dashboard** - Create merchant configuration and monitoring interface
2. **Logging & Analytics** - Implement validation logging and basic metrics
3. **Documentation** - Create user guides and API documentation
4. **Deployment Preparation** - Prepare for production deployment and scaling

## Active Questions & Unknowns

### Technical Questions
1. **Shopify Extension Limitations:** What are the specific constraints and capabilities of Checkout UI Extensions?
2. **API Rate Limits:** What are the exact rate limits for Google Maps, USPS, and UPS APIs?
3. **Caching Strategy:** How to effectively implement Redis caching with TTL and invalidation?
4. **Performance Requirements:** What are the exact response time requirements for checkout integration?

### Business Questions
1. **Pricing Model:** How will the app be priced based on order volume?
2. **Merchant Onboarding:** What is the expected setup process for new merchants?
3. **Support Requirements:** What level of customer support will be needed?
4. **Compliance:** What data protection and privacy requirements must be met?

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **API Integration Complexity:** External API integrations may be more complex than anticipated
2. **Checkout Extension Limitations:** Shopify checkout constraints may limit desired functionality
3. **Performance Under Load:** Caching and rate limiting strategies may need refinement
4. **Merchant Adoption:** Ensuring quick time-to-value for merchant satisfaction

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Implementation:** Build and test each component separately before full integration
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement thorough testing including edge cases and error scenarios
3. **Monitoring & Logging:** Add extensive logging to quickly identify and resolve issues
4. **Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement graceful degradation for external service failures
